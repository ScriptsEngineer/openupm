displayName: UI Element Bindings
description: >-
  Package for Unity that enables two-way data binding between Unity UIElements
  and game/business logic code. This reduces boiler-plate code that would
  otherwise be necessary for things like updating the UI when a property
  changes, removes the need for messy links between objects in the scene that
  can be broken easily, and allows easier unit testing of code by providing a
  layer of abstraction between the UI and your core logic code.
