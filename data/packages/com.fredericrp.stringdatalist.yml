description: >-
  Let say you want to allow your designer to edit some string properties in your
  project (you, fool) but there are only a limited amount of allowed strings,
  like characters names, seasons or anything, and for whatever reason, you don't
  want or cannot use enums. Or maybe you have a list of data, and you don't want
  to have a name property of each data nor you want the list to display -Element
  0-, -Element 1-, but instead you want to use your own names: for instance Cat,
  dog, unicorn... This is the asset for you.
